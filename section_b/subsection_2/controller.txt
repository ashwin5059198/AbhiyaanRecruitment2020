Make use of the idea of Simultaneous localization and Mapping for constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment(assuming bot has deviated from its path). 
One can make use of components like wheel encoders to approximate current position relative to the starting position.
Then find the deviation from the pre-planned path. 
Taking into account the obstacles and the pre-planned path, employ any path finding algorithm to find optimum path back to the preplanned path.
